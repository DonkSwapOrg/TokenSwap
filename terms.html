        <h5>Acknowledgement of risks:</h5>
        <p>
          You hereby acknowledges that you are fully aware and, understand, the

          not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="terms">
            A significant risk of losses of your cryptocurrencies, inherent with
            trading, holding and transacting;
          </li>
          <li class="terms">
            A risk of partial or total loss of your cryptocurrencies due to the
            exploitation by third parties of the Shibanova.io smart contracts,
            coding errors, UI, domain and DNS weaknesses;
          </li>
          <li class="terms">
            The price and liquidity of your cryptocurrencies may be subject to
            large fluctuations. The value of cryptocurrencies is derived from
            the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat
            currency for cryptocurrencies, which may result in the potential for
            permanent and total loss of value of your Cryptocurrencies should
            the market for your Cryptocurrencies disappear;
          </li>
          <li class="terms">
            Transactions made with Cryptocurrencies on the Binance Smart Chain
            are irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or
            accidental transactions are not recoverable;
          </li>
          <li class="terms">
            All Crytocurrencies transactions made on the Shibanova.io website
            are deemed to be made when recorded on a Binance Smart Chain public
            ledger. The public nature of said transactions may lead to an
            increased risk of fraud or cyber- attack.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>No financial services/advise:</h5>

          You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for
          determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and
          appropriateness of the Cryptocurrencies you acquire and the risks for
          yourself, and that the Shibnova.io team does not give advice or
          recommendations regarding Cryptocurrencies, including the suitability
          and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, such assets.
